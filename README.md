## Customize

### Add or edit vehicles
Edit `DEFAULT_VEHICLES` in `js/game.js` (id, name, price, maxSpeed, accel, turnRate, color). Example:
```js
{ id: 'sprinter', name: 'Sprinter', price: 200, maxSpeed: 80, accel: 32, turnRate: 2.8, color: 0x3a86ff }
```
- Unlocked vehicles are stored in `localStorage` under `escapeRoad.profile.v1`.
- The selected vehicle determines player handling and color.

### Change spawn rates / difficulty
- Obstacle and coin spawning occurs when road segments recycle in `updateRoad`.
- Police difficulty ramps in `updatePolice` (increasing count over time).
- Tweak probabilities and timers there to adjust the challenge.

### Adjust camera and feel
- Follow camera logic: `updateCamera` in `js/game.js`.
- Handling parameters come from the selected vehicle and `player` object.

### UI & screens
- Edit `index.html` overlay sections for Menu, HUD, Garage, Game Over.
- Styles in `css/styles.css`. Mobile buttons live under `#mobileControls`.

### Sounds
- Minimal oscillator-based placeholders in `Audio` (inside `js/game.js`).
- Replace with real assets by loading audio buffers and playing them on events (pickup, crash, siren, engine loop).

---

## Data & persistence
- Profile (`money`, `ownedVehicles`, `selectedVehicle`) is saved in `localStorage` (`escapeRoad.profile.v1`).
- Money awarded on Game Over: coins collected + distance bonus.

---

## Notes and next steps
- Replace box meshes with real models (cars, traffic, environment) and add materials.
- Add more enemy behaviors (boxing-in, ramming, road blocks) and traffic.
- Support drift/handbrake, nitro, upgrades.
- Add high score and optional online leaderboard.
- Improve performance (object pooling, InstancedMesh, tuned shadows).

## üé® Customization Guide

### Adding New Vehicles

Edit `js/vehicle.js` and add a new entry to the `VEHICLE_DATABASE` array:

```javascript
{
    id: 'your_vehicle_id',
    name: 'Vehicle Name',
    description: 'Description here',
    price: 1500,              // Cost in game currency
    maxSpeed: 70,             // Top speed
    acceleration: 20,         // Acceleration rate
    braking: 22,              // Braking power
    handling: 1.8,            // Turn rate
    color: 0xff5733,          // Hex color
    unlocked: false           // Start locked?
}
```

### Modifying Difficulty

Edit `js/police.js` in the `PoliceManager.update()` method:

```javascript
// Change difficulty scaling
this.difficulty = 1 + Math.floor(gameTime / 30); // Increase every 30 seconds

// Change max police count
this.maxPolice = Math.min(3 + Math.floor(this.difficulty / 2), 10);

// Change spawn interval
this.spawnInterval = Math.max(5, 10 - this.difficulty * 0.5);
```

### Adding New Obstacle Types

Edit `js/environment.js` in the `Obstacle` class. Add a new case in `createMesh()`:

```javascript
case 'your_obstacle':
    mesh = this.createYourObstacle();
    break;
```

Then implement the creation method:

```javascript
createYourObstacle() {
    const group = new THREE.Group();
    // Add your 3D geometry here
    return group;
}
```

### Changing Visual Style

**Colors**: Edit `styles.css` to change the UI color scheme
```css
/* Primary accent color */
.btn-primary {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color 0%, #your-color 100%);
}
```

**3D Models**: Replace the simple box geometries in vehicle and obstacle creation methods with custom geometries or loaded models

**Environment**: Modify `environment.js` to change road width, building density, or add new environment features

### Sound Effects

Replace placeholder sounds in `js/audio.js`. The current implementation uses Web Audio API oscillators. To use actual audio files:

```javascript
playSound(soundFile) {
    const audio = new Audio(soundFile);
    audio.volume = this.sfxVolume;
    audio.play();
}

// Usage
playSound('sounds/engine.mp3');
```

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Scoring System
- **Distance**: Every meter traveled counts toward your score
- **Time**: Survive as long as possible
- **Money**: Collect coins to unlock vehicles

### Police Behavior
- Police spawn behind the player at regular intervals
- They follow the player using pathfinding AI
- Police speed increases with game difficulty
- More police spawn as you survive longer

### Collision Detection
- Bounding box collision system
- Hitting obstacles or police ends the game
- Visual and audio feedback on crash

### Progression System
- Money earned during runs is permanent
- Unlock better vehicles with collected money
- Each vehicle has unique stats affecting gameplay
- Best distance is saved locally

## üîß Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js (r128)**: 3D rendering engine
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure ES6+
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **Web Audio API**: Procedural sound generation
- **LocalStorage**: Save game progress

### Browser Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Chrome 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Performance Optimization
- Object pooling for obstacles and collectibles
- Frustum culling (only render visible objects)
- Efficient collision detection (bounding boxes)
- Limited draw distance with fog
- Mobile-optimized controls and rendering

## üì± Mobile Support

The game automatically detects mobile devices and:
- Shows on-screen touch controls
- Adjusts UI scaling for smaller screens
- Optimizes rendering performance
- Supports both portrait and landscape modes

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Placeholder Audio**: Uses Web Audio API oscillators instead of actual sound files
2. **Simple Graphics**: Uses basic Three.js geometries (boxes, cylinders) instead of detailed models
3. **No Multiplayer**: Single-player only
4. **No Backend**: All data stored locally in browser

- [ ] Real 3D models for vehicles and obstacles
- [ ] Multiple environment types (desert, snow, night city)
- [ ] Power-ups (speed boost, invincibility, magnet)
- [ ] Vehicle upgrades (engine, handling, durability)
- [ ] Online leaderboard
- [ ] Daily challenges
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Particle effects (smoke, sparks, dust)

## üéÆ Gameplay Tips

1. **Drifting**: Hold SPACE while turning to drift around corners
2. **Money Route**: Plan your path to collect maximum coins
3. **Police Evasion**: Sharp turns can shake off pursuing police
4. **Vehicle Choice**: Fast vehicles are harder to control but can outrun police
5. **Save Money**: Don't buy every vehicle - save for the expensive ones
