## üõ† Customization Guide

- Add/modify vehicles: edit `src/game/services/persistence.js` in `DEFAULT_VEHICLES`.
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `maxSpeed`, `accel`, `brake`, `turnRate`, `price`, `unlocked`.
- Change selected vehicle: garage screen or set `selectedVehicleId` in local storage.
- Replace car visuals: edit `src/entities/car.js` to use your own geometry or GLTF model.
- Police tuning: `src/entities/police.js` (`maxSpeed`, `accel`, `turnRate`).
- Road/obstacles: `src/systems/spawn.js` (`roadWidth`, `segmentLength`, spawn counts, colors).
- Coin value: `sceneRun.js` updates `runMoney += 10` on collect.
- Score formula: `game/state.js` in `endRun` (distance multiplier + collected money).
- UI look: `styles.css`.
- Audio: replace placeholder synth with samples in `assets/audio` and load via `services/assets.js`.

## ‚úÖ Implemented (Skeleton)
- Main menu, HUD, game over, and garage/shop stub
- Basic car controls (keyboard + touch)
- Endless road spawn with lane markings

## üöß Next Ideas
- Import real models (GLTF) for cars and buildings
- Better city generation (intersections, traffic)
- Smarter police tactics (blocking, boxing-in)
- Drift/handbrake handling
- Upgrades (engine, handling, durability)
- Achievements and online leaderboard
